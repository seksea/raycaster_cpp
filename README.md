# Non-Euclidean Raycaster

[![Screenshot](https://github.com/seksea/raycaster_cpp/blob/master/resources/raycaster.png)](https://github.com/seksea/raycaster_cpp/blob/master/resources/raycaster.mp4)

This raycasting engine was originally developed as my A-Level NEA coursework. It offers a unique approach to raycasting, allowing it to render rooms with a "non-euclidean" layout.

Get a release build of the game [here](https://github.com/seksea/raycaster_cpp/releases/tag/windows-release)

## Features

- Raycasting: The engine employs raycasting techniques to create a 3D rendering of the environment.
- "Non-Euclidean" Room Layout: Unlike traditional raycasters, the rooms are structured as a series of rectangles that are interconnected in a tree. this means that the engine supports rooms with unconventional layouts, adding an extra layer of complexity and creativity to the game world.
- Sprites: The engine includes sprite rendering capabilities, allowing you to incorporate interactive and visually appealing elements into your game.
